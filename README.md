Mercer Island Half 2014
=======================

Wooded neighborhoods, lovely views of lake, city and mountains... and a nice little data set. I ran the [Mercer Island Half](http://mercerislandhalf.com/). Then I geeked out on the data.


##Tools

 * R
 * RStudio
 * ggplot2
 * Python


##Conclusions

Stunning insights? Women may run like girls, but most are still are faster than me. I wish I ran like a 79 year old.
